# deamhan
Perl-wrapper code that implements an analysis pipeline to detect transposon-based mutagenesis in cancers

>**deamhan**: _gaelic_ demon, devil

As with many biology-driven projects, this project was complex due to the 
inter-mix of basic cancer biology in mice, wet-lab sample preparation,
high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, mathematical
modelling and number crunching on a High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster.
The **devil** was always in the detail, hence the project name.

The code wraps around the R-version of the Common Insertion site Mapping Platform (CIMPL)
created at the [Computation Cancer Biology Group](http://ccb.nki.nl), the Netherlands Cancer Institute.
The code for the R implementation was uploaded to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NKI-CCB/cimpl)
in March 2017.

A description of the project was written up for the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute's [blog](https://sangerinstitute.blog/2014/01/03/throwing-a-spanner-in-the-works/).
